Re-build of another Discord RPC application, adding whats missing.

Credits to [@t1c.dev](https://github.com/ThatOneCalculator/) for creating the app in the first place.

This rebuild contains everything that EVERY other Custom RPC App is missing.
- Buttons
- Images (including their respective tooltips)
- States
- Description

All you have to do is create your own application into the discord developer portal, copy the App's Client ID and paste it into the Client ID label input inside the app.
